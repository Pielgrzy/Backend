# Scope
1. Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters but in a different order. Here are a few examples of anagram pairs:

    “listen” and “silent”<br/>
    “binary” and “brainy”<br/>
    “Paris” and “pairs”<br/>

  For a given input of two strings, return a Boolean TRUE if the two strings are anagrams.

2. As an added challenge, for a given array of strings, return separate lists that group anagrams together. 
For example, the input {“tar,” “rat,” “art,” “meats,” “steam”}, the output should look something like {[“tar,” “rat,” “art”], [“meats,” “steam”]}.
